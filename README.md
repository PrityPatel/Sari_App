Project #2: Building Your A Full-stack Application

### Technical Requirements

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app.
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
* **Ensure that the relationships between models** are fully implemented.
* Have **semantically correct HTML and CSS**. Feel free to use a CSS framework of your choosing.
* **Your app must be deployed and demoed online**.

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet.
* A **git repository hosted on Github**
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of:
  * The technologies used
  * Installation instructions (seed data, etc.)
  * Unsolved problems, etc.
* **Wireframes attached to a Trello card**.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't nee.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** **Commit early, commit often.** **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done. Reference back to the lesson on _Agile Development_ if necessary.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, as specified above? Did you use GitHub and commit early and often?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user - why would someone want to use your app?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as indentation, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Did not complete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
